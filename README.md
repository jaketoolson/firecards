# FIRECARDS

Proof of concept - comparing basic phonegap app to a similar native iOS one I've developed.  Although I'm targeting iOS specifically, the phonegap builds will also include Android, Blackberry, and Windows-Phones. **I'll include the compiled/downloadable application links soon.**

Aside from allowing me to test and compare the differences in setting up an application using html/js/phonegap vs. native, I also want to establish a PhoneGap boilerplate for future personal use, for simple apps. Some of the below TODO items are app-specific, but still allow me to implement the various PG API components. I do anticipate removing JQM in the future.

I've made this a public repository to allow others whom indicated interest in PG - watch progress. 

*Yup, JQM and PhoneGap - the not-so-awesome combination, but it works for this*.

### Note

I am currently making all tests leveraging JQM methods instead of PG.  This will change overtime

### TODO *(as of July 5, 2013)*:
- Implement Cordova's db/storage api.
- Create methods for retrieving **actual** data from local db/storage.
- Create appropriate doesnt-look-like-jqm-theme.
- Add user tools-per-card (favorite/forgot/star/help).
- Create Help/About pages.
- more to come
